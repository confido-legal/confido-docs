Onboarinding.js is a javascript library that lets you inject the Confido Legal onboarding form into any `div` on your page. This means your users never have to leave your app to get approved to accept payments.

Here's how it works at a high level.

1. Include **onboarding.js** on your page through a `script` tag
2. Create an Onboarding Token for a Firm
3. Call **onboarding.js**'s `renderForm` method providing the Onboarding Token and a `containerId` to render the form into
4. User fills out the form and **onboarding.js** communicates directly with Confido to submit data.
