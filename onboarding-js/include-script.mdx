title: Include the script
---

You must include the script on any page where you want to inject the Onboarding form.

<CodeGroup>

```html sandbox
<script src="https://js.sandbox.gravity-legal.com/onboarding.js" />
```

```html production
<script src="https://js.gravity-legal.com/onboarding.js" />
```

</CodeGroup>

Once the script loads, the `window` object will have a `window.confidoOnboarding` object with all the methods required to manage the onboarding process. The `confidoOnboarding` object has a method `renderForm` that we will call later to actually render the form. But first, we need to create an Onboarding Token.
