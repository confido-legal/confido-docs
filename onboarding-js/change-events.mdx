Onboarding.js will call the `onChange` handler passed into `renderForm` when certain events happen within the form.

## Event Types

| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `error_on_file_upload` | There was an error when trying to upload a file.                                                                                  |
| `error_on_load`        | There was an error loading the form.                                                                                              |
| `error_on_save`        | There was an error while saving the form data.                                                                                    |
| `error_on_submit`      | There was an error trying to submit the form.                                                                                     |
| `loaded`               | The form loaded successfully and is ready for input.                                                                              |
| `saved`                | All progress has been saved. It would be safe to navigate away from the form.                                                     |
| `submitted`            | All data has been saved and validated. The Firm will now be sent to underwriting.                                                 |
| `token_expired`        | The onboarding token has expired. You must create a new one and re-render.                                                        |
| `token_expires_soon`   | The onboarding token will expire in five or fewer minutes. The user will want to save their progress so they don't lose unsaved data. |
