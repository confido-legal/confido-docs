title: Create an Onboarding Token
---

To render the form, you will need a public Onboarding Token. The token is used by onboarding.js for authorization and scopes the requests to the Confido Firm that it was created for.

Onboarding Tokens can be shared with the client and are valid for 24 hours. If a token expires, you will need to create a new one and re-render the form.

There are two ways to create an Onboarding Token:

1. Directly through the `createOnboardingToken` mutation. Use this when you already have a Firm API Token.
2. By requesting a token in the result of the `createFirm` mutation. Use this when you know you want to render the form soon after you create the Firm.

## `createOnboardingToken` mutation

Use the `createOnboardingToken` mutation when the Firm is already created in Confido.

```graphql
mutation CreateOnboardingToken {
    createOnboardingToken {
        token
    }
}
```

<Note>
    This is a Firm level request, so you must use a Firm API Token on the `x-api-key` header. This tells us which Firm
    you want to create the token for.
</Note>

## In `createFirm` Result

You can also get an Onboarding Token in the result of a `createFirm` mutation. This is useful if you would like to immediately render the onboarding form after creating a Firm. Remember, Onboarding Tokens are valid for 24 hours.

```graphql
mutation CreateFirm() {
  createFirm() {
    onboardingToken {
      token
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
    You can find detailed information about all queries and mutations in our [GraphQL
    Playground](https://api.sandbox.gravity-legal.com/v2).
</Note>

Once you have a token, you will pass it to the client where you can render the form.
