title: Payment Links
---

Payment Links are hosted payment pages of a specified amount that are tied to a specific Client. Payment Links can be presented to the Client as standalone links or embedded into your application via an iframe.

Payment Links are the fastest way to go to market. They allow you to leverage all of our pre-built Payment Methods and other features, such as surcharging.

Payment Links also allow you to benefit from new Payment Methods we add in the future, such as client financing and Apple Pay, without additional engineering work.
