### Leverage our scheduler to run Stored Payment Methods

Think of Subscriptions as simply a scheduler that will run <a href="https://docs.confidolegal.com/docs/payment-vehicles/stored-payment-methods">Stored Payment Methods</a> on a specified schedule until specified criteria have been met.

When implementing subscription legal services or a payment plan feature, you should weigh the pros and cons of building your own scheduler and using Stored Payment Methods or using this scheduler.

The downside to using this scheduler is a lack of full control over the experience. The benefits include leveraging our set of pre-built scheduling intervals, automatic upcoming payment reminders, and logic around failed payments.

### Creation

There are two ways to create and activate a Subscription. The first is to build your subscription and attach a previously stored Stored Payment Method. The second is to generate a hosted Subscription Link on which the client can enter their payment information and automatically activate the Subscription.
