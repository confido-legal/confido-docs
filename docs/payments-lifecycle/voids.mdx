## Updated Void Flow

### New Void Query

Use `transactionVoidDetails` to preview which transactions will be affected before executing a void. This is particularly important when voiding a transaction that may impact multiple related transactions within a single payment.

### Void Execution

Replace `voidTransaction` with `transactionVoid` for executing void operations if you had previously implemented `voidTransaction`.

### Asynchronous Processing

Void requests now support asynchronous processing to accommodate varying financial institution response times:

1. **Immediate Response:** We wait up to 30 seconds for a response from the financial institution
2. **Pending Status:** If the request is still processing, we return a response with status `AWAITING_RESULT`
3. **Completion Handling:**
   - If completed within 30 seconds: You receive a success/fail status the original and new void transactions
   - If still pending: You receive a pending status response
4. **Status Updates:** [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks/webhook-types) notify you when transaction statuses change to void
5. **Request Tracking:** The `transaction` query includes a `voidRequests` field showing status and date for each void request. The status2 field will also accurately reflect voids.
