## Updated Refund Flow

### Refund Execution

Replace `refundTransaction` with `transactionRefund` for executing refund operations if you had previously implemented `refundTransaction`.

### Asynchronous Processing

Refund requests now support asynchronous processing to accommodate varying financial institution response times:

1. **Immediate Response:** We wait up to 30 seconds for a response from the financial institution
2. **Pending Status:** If the request is still processing, we return a response with status `AWAITING_RESULT`
3. **Completion Handling:**
   - If completed within 30 seconds: You receive the original and new refund transactions
   - If still pending: You receive a pending status response
4. **Status Updates:** Webhooks notify you when transaction statuses change to refunded
5. **Request Tracking:** The `transaction` query includes a `refundRequests` field showing status and date for each refund request. The status2 field will also correctly reflect refunds.
