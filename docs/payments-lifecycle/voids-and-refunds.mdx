title: Voids and Refunds
---

### Voids

After a successful payment has been made, there is a short period in which it can be voided using the `voidTransaction` mutation. This period depends on the payment method used when processing the payment.

| Payment Method | Cutoff Time (Central Time) |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Card Payment   | 10:30 PM                   |
| Ach Payment    | 12:30 PM & 9:00 PM         |

The `Transaction` object has a `canVoid` boolean that indicates whether or not the transaction can be voided.

<Warning>
    Payments on an [Aggregate Payment Link](/docs/payment-vehicles/aggregate-payment-links) can't be voided.
</Warning>

### Refunds

After a successful payment has settled, the transaction can be refunded at any time using the `refundTransaction` mutation. This mutation also contains an optional `amount` input that can be defined to make a partial refund for a specific transaction. An error will be thrown if you attempt to refund more then the original amount of the transaction.

The `Transaction` object has a `canRefund` boolean that indicates whether or not the transaction can be refunded. This is based on the expected settlement time of the transaction.

### Void or Refund

For convenience, we have also added a `voidOrRefundTransaction` mutation. However, we do not allow partial refunds when using this mutation.

### Notes

It is possible for both `canVoid` and `canRefund` to be false. This occurs when the money is in transit.
