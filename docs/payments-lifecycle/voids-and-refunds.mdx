title: Voids and Refunds
---

### Voids

After a successful payment has been made, there is a short period in which it can be voided using the `transactionVoid` mutation. This period depends on the firm settings and payment method used when processing the payment.

| Payment Method | Cutoff Time (Central Time) | _Legacy Cutoff Time (Central Time)_ |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Card Payment   | 11:00 PM                   | _10:30 PM_                          |
| Ach Payment    | 11:00 PM                   | _12:30 PM & 9:00 PM_                |

The `Transaction` object has a `canVoid` boolean that indicates whether or not the transaction can be voided.

<Warning>
  Payments on an [Aggregate Payment
  Link](/docs/payment-vehicles/aggregate-payment-links) can't be voided.
</Warning>

### Refunds

After a successful payment has settled, the transaction can be refunded at any time using the `transactionRefund` mutation. This mutation also contains an optional `amount` input that can be defined to make a partial refund for a specific transaction. An error will be thrown if you attempt to refund more then the original amount of the transaction.

The `Transaction` object has a `canRefund` boolean that indicates whether or not the transaction can be refunded. This is based on the expected settlement time of the transaction.

### Asynchronous Processing

Refund and void requests now support asynchronous processing to accommodate varying financial institution response times:

1. **Immediate Response:** We wait up to 30 seconds for a response from the financial institution.
2. **Pending Status:** If the request is still processing, we return a response with status `AWAITING_RESULT`
3. **Completion Handling:**
   - If completed within 30 seconds: You receive the original and new refund or void transactions
   - If still pending: You receive a refund or void request in the `AWAITING_RESULT` status
4. **Status Updates:** Webhooks notify you when transaction statuses change to refunded or voided
5. **Request Tracking:** The `transaction` query includes a `refundRequests` and `voidRequests` field showing status and date for each refund request. The `status_v2` field will also correctly reflect refunds or voids.

### Void or Refund

For convenience, we have also added a `transactionVoidOrRefund` mutation. However, we do not allow partial voids/refunds when using this mutation.

### Notes

It is possible for both `canVoid` and `canRefund` to be false. This may occur when the money is in transit.
