title: Trusted Domains
---

Before you can load the fields on your page you must register the domain where you will be loading the fields. You can register your domains through the Partner Portal.

You should register all domains where you plan to load the fields.

<Note>
    To make development easier, the sandbox environment does not restrict any domains. You can skip this step in
    sandbox.
</Note>

1. Log in to the [Partner Portal](https://app.confidolegal.com)
1. Navigate to **[Settings > Trusted Domains](https://app.confidolegal.com/settings)**
1. Add your domains. You can use a wildcard like `https://*.myapp.com`. Non-local domains must use `https` protocol. `http` is acceptable for `localhost` domains, although these should only be used for testing purposes.
1. Save the domains. This could take a couple of minutes to take effect.

Now you are ready to start a session.
