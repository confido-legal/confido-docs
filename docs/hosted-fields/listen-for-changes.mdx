title: Listen For Changes
---

Before you initialize the SDK you will want to add a change event listener to get notified when the internal state of the fields changes.

```javascript
const myListener = (changeEvent) => {
  console.log(`Change Type: `, changeEvent.type);
  console.log(`Current State: `, changeEvent.state);
  updateMyUI(changeEvent.state);
};

window.confidoHostedFields.addChangeListener(myListener);
```

For a full list of Change Event types and a complete description of the `state` object, see the [Hosted Fields SDK Reference Docs](/hosted-fields-js/change-events).
