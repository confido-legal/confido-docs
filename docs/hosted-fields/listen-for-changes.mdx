title: Listen For Changes
---

Before you initialize the SDK you will want to add a change event listener to get notified when the internal state of the field's change.

```javascript
const myListener = (changeEvent) => {
    console.log(`Change Type: `, changeEvent.type);
    console.log(`Current State: `, changeEvent.state);
    updateMyUi(changeEvent.state);
};

window.gravityLegal.addChangeListener(myListener);
```

For a full list of Change Event types and a complete description of the `state` object, see the [Hosted Fields SDK Reference Docs](/reference/hosted-fields-js/change-events)
