title: Create a Public Token
---

import { Note } from "@components/ui/note";

To get started, you will need to create a public token from your server. You will then pass this token to your frontend to initialize the SDK.

## Payment Sessions

Create a Payment Session Token when you want to accept money now.

You can pass a `bankAccountId` to this mutation which determines which of the Firm's Bank Accounts the money will be directed to. If you do not pass a `bankAccountId` the Firm's default operating account will be used.

```graphql
mutation PaymentSessionCreate($input: PaymentSessionCreateInput) {
    paymentSessionCreate(input: $input) {
        paymentSessionToken
    }
}
```

## Save Payment Method Session

Create a Save Payment Method Session Token when you want to save the payment details now, then use them to make a payment at a later date. You can optionally pass in a `clientId` if you know which Client this Payment Method should be saved under.

```graphql
mutation StartSavePaymentMethodSession($input: CreateSavePaymentMethodTokenInput) {
    createSavePaymentMethodToken(input: $input) {
        savePaymentMethodToken
    }
}
```

<Note type="info">
    You'll need to add the Firm API Token as the `x-api-key` header for the request. `x-api-key=f_secret_env_******`
</Note>

Return the `paymentToken` to your frontend to initialize the sdk.
