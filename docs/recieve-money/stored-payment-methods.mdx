title: Stored Payment Methods
---

### Overview

This payment vehicle, sometimes shortend to SPM, is used to save any of the Payment Methods to be charged at a later date. This vehicle is great for scenarios in which firms charge the same Client multiple times, for example on subscription legal services plans, payment plans or auto-pay.

### Creation

There are two ways a stored payment method can be created.

- Collect the Payment Method information directly from a hosted Stored Payment Method link
- Save the payment method used on a different payment vehicle, such as <a href="https://docs.confidolegal.com/docs/payment-vehicles/payment-links">Payment Links</a>

### Declines

When a decline occurs on a charge towards a Stored Payment Method, the `status` of the SPM changes to `payment_failed` and the SPM will not allow more payments until the SPM is reactivated.

The ability to reactivate a SPM is based on the reason for the decline. For example, if the decline message is _Insufficient Funds_, the SPM can be reactivated using the `reactivateStoredPaymentMethod` mutation. You can determine if a SPM can be reativated with the `canReactivate` property. You can also grab information about the decline to display to the firm with the `declineInfo` property. This can help the firm identify possible fixes before attempting to charge the SPM again.

One example of an SPM failing without being able to reactivate would be if the `declineInfo.declineMessage` was _Invalid account number_. This could occur if the client mistyped their account number when saving their ACH information. In this state, it may make sense to deactivate the SPM using the `decativateStoredPaymentMethod` mutation.
