title: "Bulk Create Disbursements"
---

To create multiple disbursements at once, use the bulk creation process. This involves invoking a GraphQL mutation that initiates a background job. The mutation will return a jobId, which you can use to track the jobâ€™s status.

Each disbursement created as part of the job will trigger a disbursement.created webhook. You can either listen for those webhooks or poll the job status endpoint to retrieve results.

## Step 1: Start the Bulk Creation Job

Use the following mutation to initiate the bulk disbursement creation job:

```graphql
mutation DisbursementsCreateBulk($createParams: [DisbursementCreateInput!]!) {
  disbursementsCreateBulk(createParams: $createParams) {
    jobId
    jobStatus
  }
}
```

**Example variables:**

```json
{
  "createParams": [
    {
      "id": "my_generated_uuid",
      "amount": 100,
      "authorizedIdentities": [
        {
          "type": "EMAIL",
          "value": "myemail@example.com"
        }
      ],
      "fundingAccountId": "the_bank_account_id"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Tip>
  You can provide a client-generated id (e.g. a UUID) for each disbursement in
  the createParams. This id will become the disbursement.id, allowing you to
  associate results with records in your own system for better traceability.
</Tip>

The response will include a jobId and initial jobStatus.

## Step 2: Check job status

To monitor the progress of the bulk disbursement job, use this query:

```graphql
query JobStatus($jobId: ID!) {
  jobStatus(jobId: $jobId) {
    status
    errors {
      index
      message
    }
    results {
      id
      disbursementId
      status
    }
  }
}
```

Pass in the jobId returned by the mutation to fetch the current status and any errors or results associated with the job.

## Additional notes

- Each successful disbursement will emit a disbursement.created webhook event.
- Errors encountered during job execution will be returned in the job status results array, indexed by the `disbursementId` originally passed in the createParams array.
