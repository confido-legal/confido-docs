title: Expiration
---

For additional security, all disbursement links will expire after a configurable number of days from approval. The `expiryDays` can be configured at the firm level or at the disbursement level.

By default, all disbursements will expire 60 days after they have been approved. When a disbursement expires, the `disbursement.updated` webhook is fired.
