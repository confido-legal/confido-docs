Use Connect when your user already has an existing Confido Legal account.

import { Note } from '@components/ui/note';

<Note type='info'>
For users without a Confido Legal account, use [Sign Up Links](/docs/firm-onboarding/sign-up-links) or [Onboarding.js](/reference/onboarding-js/overview).
</Note>

With Connect, you'll direct users to a unique Connect URL where they will authorize your application. Upon authorization, they will be redirected back to your configured Callback URL with a one time use `code` that can be exchanged for a Firm API Token. You'll then store this token in your database to use in subsequent requests to manage the Firm through the API.

Let's get started.

First we need to configure some settings in the Partner portal. Login to the portal and go to Settings > Connect.

## Add your logo

It's best if this logo is square and around 200x200 pixels. This logo will show up on the Connect authorization screen as well as the Sign Up screen when users are using a Sign Up Link.

## Copy your Connect URL

Each Partner has their own unique Connect URL. You will direct your users here to start the Connect session. You can pass an optional `state` search parameter to this URL that will be threaded through the process and returned back to you at your Callback URL. This `state` parameter can be any string.

## Setup a Callback URL

The Callback URL is where we will redirect users after they have authorized your application. The GET request will include a couple search parameters. 

`https://your_app.com/callback?code=connect_code&state=your_state`

You can exchange the `code` for a Firm API Token using the `exchangeCodeForFirmApiToken` mutation and your Partner API Token. You can use the `state` param for anything you like. For example, maybe you want to pass through the `userId` of the user who started the connect session.
