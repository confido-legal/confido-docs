Use Sign Up Links when your users do not already have an existing Confido Legal account.

With Sign Up Links, you will preemptively create a new Firm using the `createFirm` mutation and then create a unique sign up link where you will direct your user. When the user signs up using this link, they will be added as an admin to the Firm that you previously created.

import { Note } from "@components/ui/note";

<Note type="info">
    For security reasons, Sign Up Links are short-lived, one-time-use links. They are good for 20 minutes and include an
    `expiresAt` field for your convenience.
</Note>

## Create a Firm

To get started with Sign Up Links, we will first create a Firm. Use the `createFirm` mutation to do this with your Partner API Token. Here is an example.

```graphql
mutation CreateFirm($input: CreateFirmInput!) {
	createFirm(input: $input) {
		apiToken
		signUpLink {
			link
			expiresAt
		}
	}
}

{
  "input": {
    "name": "My Firm Name",
  },
  "headers": {
    "x-api-key": "your_partner_token"
  }
}
```

Once the Firm has been created, save the returned Firm API Token in your database. You will use this in all subsequent requests for the Firm.

<Note type="hint">
    The Firm can be created at any time. For instance, you could create a Firm for each account in your application in
    one bulk operation. Then later, when the user is ready, generate a Sign Up Link using the `createFirmSignUpLink`
    mutation.
</Note>

If you know that you are going to immediately direct your user to the Sign Up Link after creating the Firm, then you can save yourself a network request by asking for the `signUpLink` field in your `createFirm` query.

## Navigate to the link

Now direct your user to the Sign Up Link URL. There they will sign up for a Confido Legal account and be placed as an admin under the Firm you created. Once signed in, they will be asked to fill out our payments application so we can begin underwriting their account.

Next you will want to know when the Firm has been approved to accept payments.

Head to the next section for a discussion on monitoring the Firm's status.
