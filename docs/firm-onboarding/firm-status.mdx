When a Firm is onboarding, the `firm.status` field will go through the following values. A `firm.updated` [webhook](/docs/webhooks/configure) will be sent out every time the status changes.

`CREATED` -> The Firm was created but there haven't been any edits to the application so far.

`APP_IN_DRAFT` -> The application for the Firm has been updated and is currently being filled out.

`APP_SUBMITTED` -> The application has been submitted and is waiting for the authorized signer to complete the agreement.

`APP_IN_REVIEW` -> Agreement has been signed and the application is under review.

`ACTIVE` -> The Firm has passed underwriting and is ready to start processing payments.

`INACTIVE` -> The Firm is no longer able to process payments.

Below is a simple query that gets the status of a Firm. See the [GraphQL Playground](https://api.sandbox.gravity-legal.com/) for the complete list of fields available on the Firm object.

```graphql
query GetFirm {
  firm {
    status
  }
}

{
  "headers": {
    "x-api-key": "firm_api_token"
  }
}
```

When `status` is `ACTIVE` the Firm is ready to process payments.
