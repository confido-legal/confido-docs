### Recording offline payments

In some situations, a firm may be paid offline, such as by check, wire transfer or cash. When these events occur, a Manual Payment can be recorded to account for this payment. Manual Payments don't actually move money; they are purely for recordkeeping.

### Payment Link

To record manual payments on a Payment Link in Confido Legal, the `recordManualPaymentOnPaymentLink` mutation can be used. The Payment Link outstanding amounts will also be updated, resulting in the Payment Link status being `paid` or `partially_paid` depending on the total outstanding amount following the payment.
