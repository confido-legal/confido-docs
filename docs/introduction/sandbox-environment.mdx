title: Sandbox Environment
---

To facilitate seamless integration and thorough testing of your application, we provide a dedicated sandbox environment. Our sandbox environment is a developer-friendly space that enables you to experiment, validate, and fine-tune your integration with our payments platform without any real financial transactions taking place.

The sandbox environment is separate from your production account. You will need to sign up for a separate sandbox account to access this environment.
