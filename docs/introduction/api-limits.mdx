To ensure optimal performance and fair usage, we enforce the following usage limits and throttling policies.

### Usage limits

-   **500 requests per minute** _(per firmId or partnerId)_
-   **10 concurrent requests** _(per firmId or partnerId)_

### Throttling

Requests made beyond the limits mentioned above will result in a `429 Too Many Requests` response. When this happens wait for 60 seconds and try again.
