The Confido Legal API is structured as a GraphQL API. The API can be reached at the following endpoints.

- Sandbox: https://api.sandbox.gravity-legal.com/
- Production: https://api.gravity-legal.com/

If you want to test out and run some queries and mutations, you can visit our API playground [here](https://studio.apollographql.com/graph/Confido-Legal-vqze3p/variant/current/explorer).

### Get a Partner Account

At Confido, a Partner represents another software that is integrating with our API. This could be a legal practice management software, a CRM, or any other application that needs to interact with the Confido Legal API.

Each Partner can have many Firms under it. The Partner has access to manage these Firms.

To get started with the Confido Legal API, you will need to set up a Partner account. This will allow you to access the API and make requests on behalf of your application.

Please email **{supportEmail}** to get a Partner account set up.
