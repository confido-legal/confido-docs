title: Submitting the Fields
---

import { ObjectDoc } from "@components/ui/objectdoc";

Call this method when you are ready to submit the data in the fields. The `callback` will be invoked when the field data has been submitted successfully or there was an error.

Once the data is submitted successfully, you are ready to finish the payment on your server.

```javascript
window.gravityLegal.submitFields(callback: SubmitFieldsCallback);
```

### Example code

```javascript
const handleSubmit = () => {
    window.gravityLegal.submitFields((error) => {
        if (error) {
            // do something to show the error
            return;
        }

        // else the fields were submitted successfully
    });
};
```

export const SubmitFieldsDef = {
  name: 'submitFields(callback)',
  description: '',
  type: 'function',
  defaultFieldsOpen: true,
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'callback(err)',
      type: 'function',
      isRequired: true,
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'error',

        }
      ]
    }

]
}

<ObjectDoc objectDefinition={SubmitFieldsDef} />
