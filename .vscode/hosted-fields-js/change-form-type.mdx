title: Change the form type
---

As your UI switches between payment form types (`card`, `ach`), you must call this method to load the required fields.

Calling `setActiveForm()` changes the fields that are loaded. You must ensure that the elements where the fields will be loaded are in the DOM before calling this method.

```javascript
window.gravityLegal.setActiveForm(type: FormType): void;
```
