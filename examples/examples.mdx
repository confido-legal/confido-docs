To help get you started and provide some inspiration, we've created some examples that use our platform.

## Legal Wave

[Legal Wave](https://legal-wave.vercel.app) is an example application that highlights what can be done with the Confido Legal payments platform.

The code is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gravity-legal/legal-wave). It utilizes the popular [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) framework and is written in Typescript and React. We also use [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for UI components.

Legal Wave's account structure mimics a SaaS practice management app which would have multiple Firms, each with their own data, using the application. It allows users to create an account, connect their Confido Legal account, and accept payments through differnt Payment Vehicles. We will be continually updating this code base.

### Try it out!

We've hosted the Legal Wave application [here](https://legal-wave.vercel.app/signup). Sign up for an account and connect a Confido Legal sandbox account to try it out.

## CodeSandbox

Our Code Sandboxes are short, targeted examples showcasing one piece of our platform. They are meant to be easy to follow references, but by no means, production quality code.

### Hosted Fields - Card and ACH Form

This example shows how to use a Payment Session to collect a card and ach payment using Hosted Fields.
