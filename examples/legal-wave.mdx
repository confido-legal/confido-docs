[Legal Wave](https://legal-wave.vercel.app) is an example application that highlights what can be done with the Confido Legal platform.

The code is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gravity-legal/legal-wave). It utilizes the popular [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) framework and is written in Typescript and React. We also use [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for UI components.

Legal Wave's user account structure mimics a SaaS practice management app which would have multiple Firms, each with their own data, using the application. It allows users to create an account, connect to their Confido Legal account, and accept payments through differnt payment vehicles. We will be continually updating this code base.
